# fastImpute
This is the Julia Repository for Fast Matrix Completion. Currently it is just implemented as two functions:

1. `MatrixOptHyperJ` is for General Matrix Completion.
2. `MatrixOptHyper` is for Inductive Matrix Completion.

Current version is for Julia V0.6.

R package `fastImpute` would be available soon.
